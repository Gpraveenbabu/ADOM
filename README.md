ADOM is an *Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)-based optimization model* for removing stripe noise from remote sensing images, published in IEEE Access. It outperforms existing methods by combining:

‚úî *Weight-based detection* (preserves image details)  
‚úî *ADMM acceleration* (faster convergence)  
‚úî *No training data required* (unlike deep learning approaches)

## Key Features
- *Effective stripe removal* for both periodic and non-periodic noise  
- *Detail preservation* using adaptive weighted norms  
- *Computationally efficient* with momentum-based optimization  
- Validated on *simulated and real-world datasets* (Cuprite, Hyperion, MODIS)

## Performance Highlights
| Metric        | Noisy Image | ADOM      | Improvement |
|---------------|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| PSNR (dB)     | 25.10       | *54.91* | +29.81      |
| SSIM          | 0.40        | *0.997* | +0.597      |
| Runtime (s)*  | -           | *0.52*  | Faster than RBS, GDF |  

*Tested on 256√ó256 Hyperion image (Intel i5-7600 @ 3.50GHz)

## How It Works
1. *Optimization Formulation*:  
   - Minimizes stripe components via L‚ÇÅ and weighted L‚ÇÇ,‚ÇÅ norms  
   - Uses ADMM to split problem into efficient subproblems  

2. *Innovative Strategies*:  
   - *Weight Control*: Adjusts norms using residual parameters  
   - *Momentum Acceleration*: Speeds up convergence via Nesterov's method
